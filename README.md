### Latest Project: Bayesian vs Frequentist Approach: Educational Returns to Income in Germany

This project examines how education impacts income in Germany, addressing endogeneity by identifying a valid instrumental variable. It compares Bayesian and frequentist approaches and explores how educational effects vary across different population groups.

**Key highlights:** 

- Examined endogeneity of education and the validity of father’s education as an instrument  
- Compared Bayesian IV regression with classical 2SLS  
- Used Gibbs Sampling to estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters  
- Tested robustness of the instrument under relaxed exclusion restrictions  

**Findings:**  
- Both Bayesian IV and 2SLS suggest that one additional year of education increases income by ~7.9% on average.  
- Individuals with lower education levels benefit most, with up to a 30% increase per additional year, highlighting the importance of equitable access to education.  
- Bayesian analysis allows flexible testing of instrument validity and confirms robustness of results.
- Both Bayesian IV and 2SLS perforom similarly well.
